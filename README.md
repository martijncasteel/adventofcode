# Advent of Code 2020
I came across the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) on the 25th. I have done a lot of programming but not in Python and since it is the main language for the team I'm currently in. I thought why not give it a try.

Some code may need some refactoring after reading part 2 of some assignments. Most code can be more efficient but my goal was to keep it readable. Although I have learned a lot about list and dictionairy comprehensions and nesting them.
